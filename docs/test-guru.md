**Welcome New Members**

When someone joins the community, Test Guru sends a personalized welcome message with a friendly greeting. It helps new members feel at home and lets them know they can ask questions anytime.

**Stay in the Conversation**

After you mention Test Guru, it enters "attention mode" for 15 minutes. During this time, it can respond to follow-up messages without needing to be mentioned again - making conversations feel more natural.

### The Guru Personality

Test Guru speaks with a calm, wise tone - like a guru guiding a student. It uses metaphors and analogies to explain complex concepts. For example, when explaining the jackpot:

> "Imagine the flow of energy, like the currents of a river. With each transaction, a portion is channeled into the jackpot, growing its potential. When the river reaches its fullness, it overflows, rewarding those who have been part of its journey."

Don't worry - it keeps answers short and practical. The wisdom just makes it more memorable.

### Technical Details

Test Guru is powered by Google's Gemini AI model. It maintains conversation context so you can have back-and-forth discussions. After 15 minutes of inactivity, the conversation resets to keep things fresh.

The bot only responds in the official TRT community chat - it won't respond to random DMs or other groups.
