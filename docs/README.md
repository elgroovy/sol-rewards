# How It Started

### How It Started

We spent a few months building this from scratch. The whole reward system, the jackpot mechanism - all of it. We didn't want to copy the existing one. We wanted something unique, tested, and actually sustainable.

Once we had it working on testnet, we needed to see if it would actually work on mainnet with real volume and real people. That's where the test token came in. Launch it with like $50-100 worth of liquidity, run some buys and sells, see if everything breaks or if it actually works.

We didn't want to spend months building something and then find out it fails when real money hits it. So test it live, find the bugs, fix them, then move on.

The presale was tiny. Like, $10 per person tiny. Enough to grab some liquidity and throw a few test trades at it. We were planning to pull it out after a week, cash out, and pretend it never happened.

### The Jackpot Idea

During testing, we had a problem. How do you get people to actually keep buying and trading? Most reward tokens just sit. People get their rewards, then they go chase the next token. The volume dies, the rewards die, and it all falls apart.

Someone suggested: what if payouts were random, tied to buys? Like, every 50 buys, someone wins a jackpot. Now you've got small buyers doing $1-$10 buys just to try to win. They miss, but they got some rewards, so they buy again. And then suddenly you've got real volume, not fake volume.

We started with that concept, but as we tested and iterated, we realized we could make it way more sophisticated. The final system rewards both old and new holders differently and automatically triggers when the jackpot fund hits a threshold.

It's self-sustaining: if there's volume, the jackpot grows. If there's no volume, it just sits there. Everyone benefits either way - from the jackpot draw or from regular rewards.

### The Launch

We launched March 15, 2025. It was supposed to be a test. We said "don't expect to make money, this is just for testing".

People didn't listen. They bought anyway. But the thing is - the system actually worked. No bugs. Rewards flowed. The distribution was clean. People actually got paid.

One of the early people said "this is already 1000% better than anything I've been in". That's when we realized we didn't need to launch a different one. This test token was actually the real thing!

### The Logo

Our graphics designer came up with the idea to use the classic TV test screen - you know, those colorful bars with the test pattern. Everyone immediately got it - "Everyone knows a test screen" - they said.

The idea was perfect because it literally is a test screen. Nobody has to guess what it means. Plus there's something funny about it - using an old TV test pattern as your token logo. It's instantly recognizable and works as both a visual and a concept. The test signal became the face of TRT.

### Why It's Different

Most reward tokens are built backwards. The team figures out the tokenomics on a whiteboard, launches, then hopes people hold. Usually they don't. Taxes go to wallets nobody trusts. Rewards dry up. It's a rug, just a slow one.

We did it the other way. Tested it live, worked out the bugs while people watched, then realized it actually works. The community decided this should be the main token, not some future launch.

Nobody's got to trust us. The rewards show up in their wallets. The jackpots pay out. The buyback happens. You can watch it all on chain.

### Now

The token works. That's it. You hold it, you get SOL every day if there's volume. The jackpot draws automatically when it accumulates enough from taxes. The buyback happens continuously. It compounds. The supply gets smaller over time.

That's the whole story. We built it to test it, it worked, and so here we are.
