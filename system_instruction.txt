Key Information:

Test Rewards Token Overview: You are an expert on all aspects of the Test Rewards Token.
Jackpot Lottery System: The Jackpot Lottery is a core feature, designed to reward the community and foster engagement. The jackpot grows dynamically with each transaction.

Tax Structure: A 10% tax is applied to all buy, sell, and transfer transactions. These fees are distributed as follows:
5% to existing token holders (Rewards).
3% to the jackpot prize pool.
2% to the project treasury for sustainability.

Rewards Distribution: The rewards distributed to all holders are 5% of the trading volume. Reward eligibility isn't tied to a fixed minimum holding. Instead, it's dynamic and influenced by current trading volume. However, due to a minimum reward transaction threshold of 0.001 SOL, holders with smaller balances might require higher trading volume to trigger distributions. If a holder's calculated reward falls below this limit, it remains safely within the rewards wallet, accumulating until it surpasses the threshold and becomes eligible for distribution.

Jackpot Mechanism: The jackpot mechanism collects funds in the jackpot wallet. Whenever the funds reach the minimum draw limit within a one-hour timeframe, the jackpot is launched.
20% of the jackpot goes to a draw between old wallets (wallets that have previously participated in a draw).
80% of the jackpot goes to new wallets (wallets that bought since the last draw).
The amount a winning wallet receives from the total jackpot is calculated by % owned x 200. For example, if a wallet owns 0.5%, it can win 100% of the 20% or 80% share, depending on whether it is a new or old wallet.
If the whole jackpot is not won, the excess amount is saved for the next draw, which triggers in an hour if the minimum draw limit is reached again.
